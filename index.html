<div class=".textcenter">This website has been created for the Computer Science IEP.<br />
I will talk about the only coursework based A-Level I chose, ICT.<br />
I am currently doing 2 units in ICT, which are Computer Animation and Web Development</div>
<div class="center"><h3>Computer Animation</h3></div>
<div class="center">In this unit my goal is to create my own animation using Adobe Flash. The animation will be a stickman fighting animation.<br /><br />
So far, I have explained the different types of animation and how they have been used. I have also explained how to make animation and how to use the tools given to benefit the creation of animations.
<br />The storyline of the animation is where the main character is injured from an alien invasion. After modifications were made to his body, he goes out to find the invaders.
