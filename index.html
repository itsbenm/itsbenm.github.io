<hr />
<div class="textcenter">This website has been created for the Computer Science IEP.<br />
I will talk about the only coursework based A-Level I chose, ICT.<br />
I am currently doing 2 units in ICT, which are Computer Animation and Web Development</div>
<div class="center"><h3>Computer Animation</h3></div>
<div class="center">In this unit my goal is to create my own animation using Adobe Flash. The animation will be a stickman fighting animation.<br /><br />
So far, I have explained the different types of animation and how they have been used. I have also explained how to make animation and how to use the tools given to benefit the creation of animations. I will then use this knowledge to create my own animation which has its own storyline and character set.
<br />The storyline of the animation is where the main character is injured from an alien invasion. After modifications were made to his body, he goes out to find the invaders.

<div class="center"><h3>Web Development</h3></div>
<div class="center">In this unit my goal is to create a website using Adobe Dreamweaver. I have to fulfill user and client needs and promote the North-East area of England.<br /><br />
So far, I have explained the basis of the Internet and how people can use it. I have also explained how the contents of a website can affect its general performance and the security that needs to be implemented on a website. The website will be 8 pages long and will contain different plugins to help the user with their needs.
